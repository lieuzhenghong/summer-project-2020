What really excites me is not my own limited sphere of comparative advantage.
Instead, it's collaborating with my friends at Merton who are much more
intelligent than I am. The best thing about Merton is that you have many
excellent people studying radically different things. Yet the courses we study
are so siloed! That's why I want to seize the opportunity this summer and work
with my friends before they (and I) get so busy next year.

My second proposal is to build a path tracer, which combines computer graphics
(compsci), optics (physics), and an MCMC proposal function (statistics). Ross
knows a lot about physics, Doyun knows a lot about computer graphics and
rendering, and I know very little about anything because I studied PPE--but at
least I am keen. We will build the ray tracer from scratch in Julia, starting
simply by shooting out one ray per pixel of the camera, working out where it
intersects surfaces, then generating a second ray by sampling from the
bidirectional reflectance function (BDRF) of that surface. We will then repeat
this procedure many times until we get an image.

This project will make me really understand the maths behind MCMC, which will
give me a huge headstart in my Master's course. The project will also teach me
HPC/GPU programming, which will be useful for my future data science work.

Likely outputs: We most probably won't produce any publishable work, but we
should be able to build a nice raytracer, render pretty pictures, and learn a
lot from the process.
