Over the past year, I have been working in the field of computational
districting. I would use this summer to expand the work I have been doing, to
prevent foul play and increase representation in the political system.

Firstly, I have been collaborating with Professors Nicholas Eubank (at Duke)
and Jonathan Rodden (at Stanford), and aim to finalise a working paper of
"Accounting for Travel Times in Estimating Political Dislocation" this summer.
In their previous paper they develop a measure which detects district boundary
manipulation and gerrymandering. In this paper, I develop a version of that
measure that uses travel times -- rather than geographic distance — to more
accurately estimate the characteristics of voters’ local neighborhoods. We show
that this measure does a better job of detecting unnatural districting — e.g.
districts that jump geographic barriers like large bodies of water -- allowing
us to better identify and flag gerrymandered districts.

Secondly, I will polish my thesis and put up a working paper. In the US, many
states attempt to limit gerrymandering by requiring plans to be 'reasonably
compact' and respect 'the integrity of communities of interest'. But in order
to achieve a compact shape, one may need to draw districts that split
communities of interest, adversely affecting democratic outcomes. My thesis
therefore examines whether there is a fundamental trade-off between compactness
and communities of interest, and whether certain compactness measures are
better than others in preserving such communities. I make two main
contributions.  First, I develop a new compactness metric that incorporates
travel times. I also use Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods to generate an
unbiased ensemble of districting plans and find that my compactness measure
consistently identifies more homogeneous districts. I will try to submit the
thesis to a journal, incorporating the comments on my submitted thesis, and
rewriting it to fit journals' shorter word limits.

Finally, I will be working with the Metric Geometry and Gerrymandering Group
(MGGG) this summer. I will be building a geovisualisation library in Julia,
which will help the larger open-source community. I will also be building new
features for their webapp called Districtr which allows people to draw
districting plans and identify communities of interest. The work I do with
Districtr will allow me to cross-check my metrics with their "ground truth"
data. Does my compactness metric agree with the communities of interest agreed
upon by the Districtr communities? And if there are bad actors trying to draw
gerrymandered plans on Districtr (an open problem they are trying to solve),
the metric I am building with Eubank and Rodden could pick it up.

Overall, the work I am doing tries to attack the problem of unfairness in
elections from three different (but related) angles.

I aim to put up at least two working papers with a view towards publishing
them. This closely relates to my upcoming Master's in data science. The summer
grant would help defray the costs of running the many computationally-expensive
simulations I will require for my working paper.
